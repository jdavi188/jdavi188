<title>A Guide on Developing 35mm Film</title>
</head>
<br>
<h1>Milestone 1</h1>
<br>
<h3>Topic of Choice: The Development Process of 35mm Film + Prints</h3>

<p><strong>What is the purpose of the site?</strong> <br>To inform photographers that are interested in 35mm film, how to develop film and prints. This website will also include print manipulation techniques to get 'different' and 'cool' prints.
<br>
<br>
<strong>What do you want the web site to accomplish?</strong> <br>I want this site to be a learning opportunity and digital source for people who want to learn an old, yet remarkably interesting skill.
<br>
<br>
<strong>What opportunity, problem, or issue is your site addressing?</strong> <br>With DSLRs cameras and digital photography overtaking darkroom photography, this once popular task has become rare. I want to inform people about where and how photography started.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Who is your intended audience? Be specific.</strong> <br>Experienced digital photographers, unexperienced photographers, and just about any artist willing to learn a classic skill.
<br>
<br>
<strong>What type of content might be included in your site? Be specific.</strong> <br>How to tutorials on how to develop film and prints, how to manipulate them, and different process techniques. Might include a breif history.
